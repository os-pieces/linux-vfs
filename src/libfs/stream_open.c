 * stream_open is used by subsystems that want stream-like file descriptors.
 * Such file descriptors are not seekable and don't have notion of position
 * (file.f_pos is always 0 and ppos passed to .read()/.write() is always NULL).
 * Contrary to file descriptors of other regular files, .read() and .write()
 * can run simultaneously.
 *
 * stream_open never fails and is marked to return int so that it could be
 * directly used as file_operations.open .
